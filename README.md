# About

This is a repo to collect everything that i have done in the Machine Learning course on Coursera.

# Structure

Each Folder has the name of the week of the course, the missing ones are from week where they didn't gave us any pracice. Inside every folder there's going to be a folder with the Python version of it.

# Further development

Since Python 3 is the main language for data science and especially for Machine Learning, i'll be passing all the work in R to Python3 to have all those basic implementations in Python 3.
